# Car-Price-Prediction-Model-using-Linear-Regression
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices using a linear regression model. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. It aims to accurately estimate car prices based on various features, providing a valuable tool for buyers, sellers, and dealerships.The objective is to develop a model that accurately estimates the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

# Project Overview
Accurate car price prediction is essential for buyers, sellers, and dealerships. By leveraging a linear regression model, this project aims to provide a reliable tool for estimating car prices based on historical data. The dataset used includes various features that influence car prices, and the model is trained to learn the relationships between these features and the target variable (car price).

# Objectives
Collect and preprocess a dataset of car listings.
Train a linear regression model to predict car prices.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Deploy the model for practical use in predicting car prices.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

-  Make
Model
Year
Mileage
Engine size
Fuel type
Transmission type
Number of doors
Car condition
Location
And more...

# Methodology
Data Collection: Gathering car listing data from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features and selecting the most impactful ones.
Model Training: Training a linear regression model on the processed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

# Tools and Technologies
Python: For data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.
Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing.
